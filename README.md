# Plans to work for Nguyen
Box as a spirit
    Define the shape
        Think if it will only appear on debug mode
        If it is choose the best sizes
    Only active for developer
    Specify how the colors will appear on
    Specify if a voice of the thinking will exist
Mic as an input
    Separate sounds listen
    Focus on user voice
    Remove noise from sounds
    Make patterns if sounds
    Future: differentiate voices
Screen as eyes
    Identifiate every shape
    Convert a 2D shape into 3D shape using deduction (GAN like)
    Convert 3D shape into 4D shape using deduction (GAN like)
    Zoom on different part of screen
    Create a 3D space of the screen
    Minimize the screen data using shapes
