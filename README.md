# Plans to work for Nguyen
Box as a spirit
    Define the shape
        Think if it will only appear on debug mode
            first proposal white color debug mode
            second proposal black color debug mode
            third proposal green color debug mode
        If it is choosen the best sizes
            first proposal 124*124
            second proposal 512*512
            third proposal 1024*1024
        Else team will be split into other teams
            first proposal go on a team of first big point
            second proposal go on a team of second big point
            third proposal go on a team of third big point
    Only active for developer
        Think about how to activate the developer mode
            first proposal use a key touch
            second proposal use a voice speech
            third proposal use a special button
        Think how to switch between developer and production mode
            first proposal use a key touch
            second proposal use a voice speech
            third proposal use a command line
        Specify the police of the developer mode
            first proposal cabria
            second proposal comics sans ms
            third proposal Times New roman
    Specify how the colors will appear on
        Choose between black/white or colors
            first proposal choose black/white
            second proposal choose colors
            third proposal choose black/white for a specific task and colors for another specific task
        Can it be similar color of the real color ?
            first proposal use the real colors
            second proposal use the primary colors
            third proposal use the AVG of colors on video
        Synthesis of choices of the colors of the box
            first proposal resume all choices
    Specify if a voice of the thinking will exist
        Etablish the show of the voice (text or audio)
        Prototype the voice of the thinking using last meeting
        If it works correctly validate or try the other way
Mic as an input
    Separate sounds listen
        Choose clustering or classification
        Use the method choosen
        If it works correctly validate or try the other way
    Focus on user voice
        Show all voices
        Select user voice
        Match voices with user voice
    Remove noise from sounds
        Detect noises
        Manage noises
        Remove noises
    Make patterns if sounds
        Define the pattern
        Find 3 patterns
        Elaborate a pattern finder
    Future: differentiate voices
Screen as eyes
    Identifiate every shape
        Get all different shapes
        Label the first ten shapes
        Create a model to autolabel shapes
    Convert a 2D shape into 3D shape using deduction (GAN like)
        Select 10 2D images 
        Convert previous images into 3D images
        Determine if model works
    Convert 3D shape into 4D shape using deduction (GAN like)
        Select 10 3D images
        Convert previous images into 4D images
        Determine if model works
    Zoom on different part of screen
        Select 5 images to treat
        Detect interesting zone
        Convert the detecting zone into an image
    Create a 3D space of the screen
        Select 5 possibly screen
        Try to convert them into 3D space
        Check if it works
    Minimize the screen data using shapes
        Select the main shapes of a screen
        Remove the background of the screen
        Check if the results is ok
        
# Synthesis of the plan
Box (4 teams), mic (4 teams) and screen (6 teams)
